LAP Data Formats
================
There are 5 data extracts formats used as inputs to the student data processing.
Typically, formats 1,2,3 are extracted from an SIS. Formats 4 and 5 are from an LMS.
All files are CSV files and the columns must be in the order shown.
See the sample files for examples.

NOTES
=====

1. Recoding Required to work with Weka  
   Certain Variables in each of these data sets have to be recoded to replace numeric values as Weka works only with numeric values.
    * Alternative ID - no recoding necessary
    * Course ID - no recoding necessary
    * Race {1= White, 2= American Indian or Alaska Native, 3=Asian, 4=Black or African American, 5=Hispanic, 6=Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 7= Two or More Races}
    * Gender M (male), F (female), converted in DB: {1 = Female, 2 = Male}
    * Full-time or Part-time Status {1 = Full-time student, 2 = Part-time student}
    * Class Code: FR(Freshman), SO(Sophomore), JR(Junior), SR(Senior), GR(Graduate), converted in DB {1 = FR, 2 = SO, 3 = JR, 4 = SR, 5 = GR}
    * University Standing {0 = Probation, 1 = Regular standing, 2 = Semester honors / dean list}
    * Pell Status: 1=Yes and 2=No
    * Letter Grade

            4.0 = A 
            3.7 = A-
            3.3 = B+
            3.0 = B 
            2.7 = B-
            2.3 = C+
            2.0 = C 
            1.7 = C-
            1.0 = D 
            0.0 = F 
            null = I or W

2. Aptitude score  
   Defined as the SAT composite score or the converted ACT to SAT score.  In  the cases in which students have  both SAT and ACT scores, the  SAT score will remain

3. Age  
   Converted from the birth date, expressed in years.

4. Academic_Risk  
   Defined as students completing the course within the normal timeframe and receiving a grade of C or better.
