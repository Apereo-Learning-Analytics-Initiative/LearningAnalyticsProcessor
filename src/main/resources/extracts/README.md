    * Alternative ID - no recoding necessary
    * Course ID - no recoding necessary
    * Race {1= White, 2= American Indian or Alaska Native, 3=Asian, 4=Black or African American, 5=Hispanic, 6=Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 7= Two or More Races}
    * Gender {1 = Female, 2 = Male}
    * Full-time or Part-time Status {1 = Full-time student, 2 = Part-time student}
    * Class Code {1 = FR(Freshman), 2 = SO(Sophomore), 3 = JR (Junior), 4 = SR(Senior), 5 = GR(Graduate)}
    * University Standing {0 = Probation, 1 = Regular standing, 2 = Semester honors, 3 = Semester honors and dean list}
    * Letter Grade

            4.0 = A 
            3.7 = A-

            2.0 = C 
            1.7 = C-
            1.0 = D 
            0.0 = F 
            null = I or W

2. Aptitude score  
   Defined as the SAT composite score or the converted ACT to SAT score.  In  the cases in which students have  both SAT and ACT scores, the  SAT score will remain
